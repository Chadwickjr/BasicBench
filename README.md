BasicBench v2.2.3

- Note that the application tends to freeze when you run a cpu test and may even become unresponsive.

- If this happens, give it a few seconds to finish running the test (should take no more than 30 some seconds) and things should go back to normal

- However, if the same happens while running the GPU test, click the run button again, this is a common error

- Don't minimise / close the second popup window with the cube rendering when running the GPU test, this will cause the program to not run correctly and return a much higher frame rate response than normal

- Take the 'average results' with a grain of salt, I only tested a few different systems


- Also, keep in mind this was made by an idiot high schooler, so it may be slow and buggy and the results may not be entirely correct
